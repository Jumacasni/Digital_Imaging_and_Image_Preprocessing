# Digital Imaging and Image Preprocessing

### Juan Manuel Castillo Nievas

This course was taken in Lappeenranta University of Technology (LUT) in Lappeenranta (Finland) during my Erasmus academic year in 2017-2018.

This practical assignment is composed of 3 matlab files:

- main.m is the main function. The correct way of using this function is writing main(name_of_image), so the output will be the result of our project.

- calibration_data.m is used in the main function. This function calibrates the image. This function uses the pictures dark_x.JPG, bias_x.JPG and flatfield_x.JPG. The responsability of them is explained in point number II in the documentation.

- detect_object.m is used in the main function, after calibrating the image. This function detects an object in an image and calculates the intensity of it.

These functions are explained in the documentation, in point number V. 

The documentation is divided in 6 sections:
- Section I is a brief introduction about measuring intensity.
- Section II explains the calibration of the images and how to calibrate them.
- Section III explains the identificacion of an object in an image.
- Section IV explains the environment and the equipment used, as well as the properties of it.
- Section V explains the source code used in Matlab and how to use it.
- Section VI is a the conclusion of the practical assignment, our results.
